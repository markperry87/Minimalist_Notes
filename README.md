# Minimalist Notes

This is a simple Android app using Jetpack Compose and DataStore to demonstrate saving and loading text input persistently.

This was the first thing I put together in Android Studio. It's an extremely simple notes app (just text entry and the ability to save your text). I have been using it on my phone and I kind of like how simple it is compared to other notes apps I've tried.

## Features
- Uses **Jetpack Compose** for UI.
- Saves and retrieves a note using **DataStore**.
- Automatically updates the saved note as the user types.

## How It Works
1. Open the program
2. Type whatever you want
3. Close the program (your text saves automatically)
4. Open the program and read your notes, or make new notes.
